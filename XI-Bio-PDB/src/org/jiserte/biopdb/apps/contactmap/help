ContactMapper - Creates a list of contacts for a PDB file.
 
Usage: 
   contactmapper.jar <Option>
  
Options:
   --infile           Strings. Path to the input PDB file.
                
   --outfile          String. Path to the resulting file with the contacts.
   
   --criteria         Criteria to select pair of residues that are in contact.
                        Default criteria is closest atom between two residues
                        must be a 6 or less Angstroms using a 3D grid to bin 
                        points (binned3d,6).
                        Criterias: available are:
                         - closest,X       | where X is a distance in Angstroms
                           Searches every atom pair.
                         - binned,X        | where X is a distance in Angstroms
                           Bins atoms by distance to the origin.
                         - binned3d,X      | where X is a distance in Angstroms
                           Bins atoms in a 3D grid.
                         - chain,X         | where X is a PDB Chain
                           Atoms in pair must belong to the given chain.
                         - chains,X,Y,..   | where X,Y,.. are PDB chains
                           Atoms in pair must belong to any given chain.
                         - diffchain,X,Y,..| where X,Y,.. are PDB chains
                           Atoms in pair must belong to any given chain, but 
                           cannot be the same chain.
   
   --draw             String. Path to an file where to export an image of the 
                        contact map.

   --withChains       Flag. Shows the chains identifiers in the output.
   
   --withAtoms        Flag. Shows atom numbers in the output.
   
   --withCoordinates  Flag. Shows the atomic coordinates of the points used to 
                        calculate distance.
   
   --help             Shows this help and exit.
